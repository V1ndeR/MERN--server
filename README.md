# Stack MERN - MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS

I want to try to repeat a site like habr(create posts, infinite scrolling feed). Frontend + Backend, still in development...

At the moment there is registration, authentication (jwt) and authorization, the ability to create posts with video files, pictures and descriptions, an endless scrolling feed

# Getting Started 

Download client repository [MERN--client](https://github.com/V1ndeR/MERN--client) and server repository [MERN--server](https://github.com/V1ndeR/MERN--server).

## Available scripts

Install all dependencies in server and client:

### `npm i`

In the client's project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
